# Interactive-Image-Segmentation

When was the last time you needed to segment an image?

There are numerous image segmentation algorithms available today. This field in particular has ssen numerous contribution over the years. Currently with the onset of deep learning in Computer Vision, neural networks are doing a far better job than nearly every traditional approach to this day.

However, machines still don't perceive images the way a human eye does. Segmentation goes a long way from merely distinguishing between contrasting colors to figuring out mild differences in subtle gradients. 

With this being said a human-aided/interactive way is needed to segment images properly. This repo uses an open source computer library named OpenCV for the above mentioned purpose.

## Software and Installation

I recommend installing the latest version of OpenCV or atleast 3.0.0 or above. 

## About this repo

You can find `interactive_segmentation.py` file in the `codes` folder. Running this file will open two windows. One window containing the image you want to manually segment. Another wondow contains the segmented portions of the image. 

- If you want to clear what you have done, hit the spacebar. 
- Hit lowercase 's' if you want to save the segmented image and quit. Saved images are stored in the `results` folder. 
- Press the 'Esc' key if you want to quit the program without saving anything.
